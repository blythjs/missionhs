            <p>826 Valencia is a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting students ages six to eighteen with their creative and expository writing skills and to helping teachers inspire their students to write.</p>

            <h3>Program Description</h3>

            <p>Our services are structured around the understanding that great leaps in learning can happen when trained tutors work one-on-one with students and that strong writing skills are fundamental to future success. We offer a range of programs, all free of charge, for students, classrooms, and schools in the Bay Area. Our project-based approach allows students ownership over the writing process, and strengthens their ability to express themselves clearly and in their own voice. By making writing fun, by demystifying the process, and by creating gorgeous books, magazines, and newspapers that honor their work, we can inspire young people to gain critical skills and write with confidence.</p>

            <p>Minds Matter SF provides a intensive college prep program for high-achieving low income students. These students enroll in the Minds Matter program as sophomores and spend three years completing rigorous academic coursework including professionally-taught test taking prep and writing curriculum, receiving mentoring from two dedicated young professionals, attending college summer programs at leading universities and receiving expert guidance on the college admissions process. All these services are free to all admitted students thanks to the generosity of our partners and donated time of some of city&#39;s most high achieving young professionals. In order to complete the program, students must attend Minds Matter&rsquo;s sessions every Saturday during the school year. Each session lasts four hours with the typical sessions being split between test taking prep and 2-1 mentor-mentee sessions. Given the program&rsquo;s intensity, Minds Matter only admits students who are high-achievers and have a strong determination to attend college.</p>

            <h3>Program Description</h3>

            <p>Peer Health Exchange recruits, selects, and trains college student volunteers to teach high school students a comprehensive health curriculum consisting of thirteen standardized health workshops on topics ranging from decision-making and sexual health to substance abuse and nutrition. In the classroom, PHE high school students articulate their values and goals, learn basic, accurate health information, explore attitudes and perceptions of peer norms and peer pressure, analyze the influence of culture and the media on health, discuss barriers to healthy behaviors and strategies to overcome them, and identify and learn how to use the health resources in their communities. PHE volunteers help high school students practice skills such as effective communication, risk evaluation and prevention, limit- setting, and decision-making in role-plays and scenarios that resemble difficult, real-life situations.</p>

At SFWAR, we believe that no single individual, organization, foundation, or business alone can stop the epidemic of sexual assault, but by responding as a whole community, we each bring our piece of the solution. SFWAR is a women of color led, volunteer-based organization that has provided rape crisis services to survivors of sexual assault for over 40 years. As the primary provider of rape crisis services in San Francisco, we also offer support to friends and families of survivors and provide expert advice, training, and assistance to healthcare workers, medical professionals, educators, law enforcement officers and other professionals throughout the city. The direct services offered include a 24-hour crisis hotline, short-term peer counseling, long-term rape survivor support groups, medical accompaniment and advocacy, and legal advocacy. Our prevention programs have reached young people in classrooms in schools serving every area of San Francisco, and provided information and resources to people of all ages through community programs and through the planning and coordination of numerous community events (i.e. Artists Against Rape, SF Walk Against Rape). All our services are confidential and free of charge.</p>

            <p>Students can only enter the program in their 9th grade year. Preference will be given to low-income students and those who are the first generation in their family to attend college.</p>

Individualized college and financial aid advising helps students pursue post-secondary school. Resources for students in and after college support strong academic performance, college persistence, and career exploration.</p>

            <p>It is easy to get lost in the shuffle at a big high school, and sometimes that means your grades start to slip. Tutorpedia&#39;s advisory is for students looking for a more personalized experience in school. We will match you up with an adult mentor, and you will meet with them once a week, 1-on-1, for the entire school year! Your mentor can help you in your academics, as well as help you through other school issues that might come up.<br />
            <br />
            Tutorpedia Foundation will also work 1-on-1 with eight 9th graders after school. Students will be selected by application, and selected from a pool of students who currently work with Juma Ventures.</p>

            <h3>Participant Requirements</h3>

            <p>No specific requirements - students must attend Mission High School full time and participate in either the 10th grade advisory who has selected to work with us, or participate in Juma&#39;s Aspire program.</p>
